# Science & Analytics Team

[The Freshwater Trust](https://thefreshwatertrust.org) protects and restores freshwater ecosystems using science, technology, and incentive-based solutions. 

We practice [quantified conservation](https://www.thefreshwatertrust.org/about-us/) to make positive impacts on a timeline and scale that truly matters.  We work together with committed stakeholders to continuously develop the following products and services: 

- [BasinScout:registered:](https://github.com/thefreshwatertrust/.github/blob/main/profile/basinscout.md)
- [StreamBank:registered:](https://github.com/thefreshwatertrust/.github/blob/main/profile/streambank.md)
- [Geospatial tools and technology](https://github.com/thefreshwatertrust/.github/blob/main/profile/tools.md)

With more than 40 years of on-the-ground experience, The Freshwater Trust is the largest restoration-focused organization in the Pacific Northwest and the second largest conservation group based in Oregon.  We are a 501(c)(3) organization.
