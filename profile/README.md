# Science & Analytics

The Freshwater Trust protects and restores freshwater ecosystems. Using science, technology and incentive-based solutions, weâ€™re changing the course of conservation on a timeline that matters.  We practice [quantified conservation](https://www.thefreshwatertrust.org/about-us/) by working together with committed stakeholders to continuously develop the following products and services: 

- [BasinScout:registered:](https://github.com/thefreshwatertrust/.github/blob/main/profile/basinscout.md)
- [StreamBank:registered:](https://github.com/thefreshwatertrust/.github/blob/main/profile/streambank.md)
- [Geospatial tools and technology](https://github.com/thefreshwatertrust/.github/blob/main/profile/tools.md)

With more than 40 years of on-the-ground experience, The Freshwater Trust is the largest restoration-focused organization in the Pacific Northwest and the second largest conservation group based in Oregon.  We are a 501(c)(3) organization.
