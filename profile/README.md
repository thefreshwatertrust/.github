## Quantified Conservation

The Freshwater Trust is pioneering the next generation of conservation. Moving beyond a procedure-based past to an outcome-based future is an approach called Quantified Conservation. It’s about ensuring every action translates to a positive outcome for the environment. It’s about leveraging the best practices used by businesses and social sector organizations to restore the state of our natural resources.  We put quantified conservation to work and offer services that accelerate the pace and scale of restoration.
