# BasinScout

BasinScout is an integrative modeling framework for structured decision making. It provides information to quantitively evaluate watershed management alternatives that employ natural infrastructure, best management practices, and other "distributed" projects. BasinScout is used to identify the most cost-effective suite of site-level land and water management actions that can be implemented to achieve specific water resource objectives. Based on constraints specified by stakeholders, the tradeoffs among potential strategies can be evaluated using a variety of water quality, water quantity, habitat, and economic metrics.  

BasinScout operates as a series of data pipelines, transforming geospatial and related data into decision making insights. It's a customizable system based on the watershed(s) being evaluated, integrating available data inputs, the latest relevant analytic models, scientific expertise, and stakeholder values. BasinScout enables four primary analytic components at scale: 

1. characterizing all potential projects sites within a system; 
2. evaluating the relevant projects that can potentially be implemented at each site (based on physical, financial, and social feasibility criteria); 
3. quantifying the economic costs and water resource impacts of implementing feasible projects at specific sites (alone or in combination); 
4. using the resulting site-level cost-benefit data to identify cost-optimized, multi-benefit water resource solutions at the landscape scale (a process referred to as "program design")

BasinScout has been applied to develop strategies for improvements in surface water quality (nutrient, sediment, and temperature impairments), surface water flows, groundwater levels, and habitat availability. Project types assessed through BasinScout thus far have primarily been those most applicable in agricultural and rural landscapes, such as on-farm irrigation system upgrades, vegetated buffer strips, cover cropping, riparian reforestation, irrigation delivery system piping, return drain wetlands, water rights leasing, on-farm aquifer recharge, crop conversion, cattle fencing, and restoration of (or management for) habitats on agricultural fields. 

Currently, BasinScout is applied by The Freshwater Trust in partnership with stakeholders. We provide stakeholders with access to web-based interactive decision support and scenario planning dashboards that allow them to evaluate funding and implementation strategies.
