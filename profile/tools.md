# Tools and Technology

## GIS

GIS is the foundation of our work at The Freshwater Trust.  GIS helps manage, analyze and model geospatial and related data so that we can make smarter decisions to better conserve resources and protect biodiversity. Our GIS tools include:

- QGIS
- Google Earth Engine
- Esri ArcGIS

The Freshwater Trust uses GIS to answer a wide range of questions regarding spatial relationships at our project sites – from planning and design to implementation, data analysis, cartography and reporting. Our staff routinely employ GIS to perform accurate earth measurements, conduct spatial analysis involving geometric properties and perform remote “field” sampling.  GIS also affords us capacity for complex analysis using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and satellite data and to perform change detection, site selection modeling and hydrologic modeling.

## Models

The Freshwater Trust uses publicly available, peer-reviewed models to quantify the benefits of conservation actions:

- Stream Function Assessment Methodology: rapidly assesses, evaluates, and scores stream and streamside function
- Instream Flow Crediting Protocol: rigorous and replicable process to generate credits from cooperative projects that aim to keep more water instream
- Shade-a-lator: predicts a reduction in water temperature from shade created by planting streamside vegetation using Heat Source model and TTools
- Water Temperature Transaction Tool: calculates the water temperature benefits from leaving additional water instream
- Nutrient Tracking Tool (NTT): models the reduction in nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment runoff from implementing on-farm conservation actions, like cover cropping or irrigation upgrades
- USGS MODFLOW: accurately, reliably, and efficiently simulate groundwater flow
- Colorado StateMod: surface water allocation and accounting model capable of simulating various historical and future water management policies in a river basin
