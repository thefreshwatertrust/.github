# StreamBank:registered:

StreamBank is a toolkit designed to measure and monitor quantified conservation metrics.  Research, innovation and technology are the driving forces behind ensuring the actions we take deliver quantifiable positive outcomes for a river, watershed, or basin. We analyze data, model outcomes, and develop rigorous systems and protocols to quantify the environmental benefits of every restoration action.

We call these benefits “uplift.” Uplift is calculated by measuring the conditions of an ecosystem prior to a restoration project and then modeling the conditions that will result after a project has been implemented. Calculating the environmental uplift for a potential restoration site can provide a robust picture of the project’s true ecological value, and help to prioritize implementation across a watershed. After a project is implemented, we use StreamBank to conduct long-term project monitoring to ensure that the project site is on-track to achieve the modeled benefits.  StreamBank is comprised of the following:

- StreamBank Monitoring App, a tablet-optimized application for collecting monitoring data in the field, and compiling that data for long-term analysis and reporting.
- StreamBank Administrative Toolkit, a program management tool that allows for efficient implementation and tracking of large-scale watershed programs. Provides streamlined coordination among teams and project quality assurance.

The Freshwater Trust uses StreamBank extensively with program partners.
